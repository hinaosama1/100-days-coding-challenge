/*25. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called 
alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'. 
" Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player 
just earned 5 points. 
" Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails 
will have no output.)*/

//conditional statement
//if statement


let alien_color = "green";
if( alien_color == "green"){
    console.log(`player just earned 5 points`); //print if statement
}else{
    
}
//now change the "if" statement from "else" statement
//change the "green" from array to "white" then
//we will print the text in console with "else" statement
//answer will be empty coz we did'nt print any text in {}
